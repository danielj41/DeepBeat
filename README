HOW TO RUN:

Load http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~dpjohnso/DeepBeat/ in Chrome.

HOW TO INSTALL FROM SOURCE:

Put the entire directory on a server and load index.html in Chrome. Do not open index.html as a file, since cross origin requests are not allowed for the file protocol.

One option for running a server locally: Install node, then run "npm install http-server -g", then run "http-server" in the DeepBeat directory, and load http://localhost:8080/
